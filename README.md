## Features

- **Premium UI / UX** — Completely redesigned using modern glassmorphic elements, glowing gradients, and a sleek layout inspired by tools like Linear and Notion.
- **Dark & Light Mode** — Fully persistent, CSS-variable driven theme system that switches seamlessly without reloads.
- **Role-based access control** — Two roles: `admin` and `member`. The first account registered automatically becomes the admin.
- **Project management** — Admins create and manage projects, add members, and delete projects (cascades to tasks).
- **Kanban task board** — Tasks move horizontally through three statuses: *To do*, *In progress*, and *Done*.
- **Dashboard** — Real-time stats (total tasks, completed, overdue) filterable by project and team member.
- **Secure authentication** — JWT tokens with configurable expiry; passwords hashed with bcryptjs (12 rounds).
- **Production-hardened API** — Helmet security headers, CORS, rate limiting, and centralized error handling with `express-validator`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | ≥ 18 |
| npm | ≥ 9 |
| MongoDB | ≥ 6 (local or Atlas) |

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/faizankhan308/team-task-manager.git
cd team-task-manager

# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install server dependencies
npm install --prefix server

# Install client dependencies
npm install --prefix client
```

### Environment Variables

Create `server/.env` with the following content:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/team-task-manager
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Create `client/.env` with the following content:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Running the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the Express API server and the Vite dev server concurrently.

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| API health check | http://localhost:5000/health |

## Usage

1. **Sign up** — Register the first account (it automatically becomes admin). Additional accounts default to the `member` role.
2. **Create a project** *(admin only)* — Navigate to **Projects**, add a project name and description, and assign team members.
3. **Create tasks** *(admin only)* — Open the **Task Board**, fill in the task form (title, project, assigned user, due date), and click **Create task**.
4. **Track work** *(all users)* — Use the **Task Board** to see tasks grouped by status. Change a task's status via its dropdown. Overdue tasks are highlighted in red.
5. **Monitor progress** — The **Dashboard** shows total, completed, and overdue task counts. Use the project and user filters to narrow the view.
6. **Manage roles** *(admin only)* — Promote members to admin or demote admins to member via `PATCH /api/users/:id/role`.

## Deployment

### Single-service (Railway, Render, Fly.io)

Express serves both the API and the built React app from a single process, making it straightforward to deploy on any Node.js-capable platform.

1. Connect your repository to your platform of choice.
2. Provision a MongoDB instance (a managed Atlas cluster or a platform plugin).
3. Set the following environment variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
MONGO_URI=<your MongoDB connection string>
JWT_SECRET=<long random production secret>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLIENT_URL=<your deployed app URL>
```

4. Most platforms run `npm install` automatically in the root. Set the **build command** to install the sub-package dependencies and build the React client:

```bash
npm install --prefix server && npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client
```

5. Set the **start command** to:

```bash
npm start
```

In production, Express serves the built React SPA from `client/dist` and handles all non-`/api` routes with `index.html` for client-side routing.

### Vercel (client only)

A `client/vercel.json` rewrite rule is included for deploying the React frontend to Vercel as a standalone SPA. In this configuration you will need to host the Express API separately and point `VITE_API_URL` at its public URL before building.
